# Application Load Balancer

[Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) can be used to re-route requests when certain traffic patterns are met. While traffic can be routed to services such as EC2 it [can also be routed to Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/lambda-functions-as-targets-for-application-load-balancers/) which can in turn be used process incoming requests.

The Serverless Framework makes it possible to setup the connection between Application Load Balancers and Lamdba functions with the help of the `alb` event.

## Event definition

```yml
functions:
  albEventConsumer:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - alb:
          listenerArn: arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:12345:listener/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/
          priority: 1
          conditions:
            host: example.com
            path: /hello
```
